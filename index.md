Hello, I'm **Shay**.

I am a **Software & Algorithm Engineer** specializing in developing deep learning tools for automated systems. Currently, I am pursuing my MSc in Computer Science at Reichman University. 

My expertise lies in integrating advanced **computer vision models** with hardware systems to enable **smart automation**, such as the microscope control tools I built to facilitate the rapid structural tracking of COVID-19 variants.

[cite_start]Previously, I worked at **General Motors**, developing analytical infrastructure for autonomous vehicle stacks[cite: 21, 22].
