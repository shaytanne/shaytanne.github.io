## About Me
I am a Computer Science MSc student specializing in **Reinforcement Learning**. I bring 3+ years of industrial R&D experience in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Autonomous Driving** systems.

My work focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical RL concepts and robust, large-scale industrial deployment.

## Research & Industry Experience

### **General Motors (2022-2025)**
*Algorithm Engineer, Perception Stack*
* **Focus:** Performance analysis and evaluation of deep learning models for autonomous driving.
* **Key Contribution:** Engineered automated pipelines using **PyTorch** to evaluate perception models on petabyte-scale datasets. Designed custom metrics for edge-case detection (occlusion, weather) that drove architectural decisions for the production AV stack.
* **Tech:** PyTorch, Python, NumPy, Large-scale Data Analysis.

### **Biotech Startup (Spin-off from UBC Lab)**
*Computer Vision Researcher*
* **Focus:** Automating Cryo-EM data collection using CNNs.
* **Key Contribution:** Co-developed a computer vision tool for virus molecular classification. My work on the CNN architecture optimized data collection speed by 4-10x and was integrated into the startup's core commercial product.

## Code & Projects

**[1] Perception Evaluation Utilities (Technical Showcase)**
* **[View Repository](LINK_TO_YOUR_PERCEPTION_REPO)**
* *Description:* A technical demonstration of the PyTorch patterns and evaluation architectures I implemented in industry.
* *Note:* Due to strict IP agreements with GM and previous employers, production source code cannot be released. This repository serves as a "clean room" implementation of similar utility classes.

**[2] Reinforcement Learning Coursework**
* *Description:* Current implementations of fundamental RL algorithms (DQN, PPO) as part of my MSc degree.
