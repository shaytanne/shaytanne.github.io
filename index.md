Hello, I'm **Shay**.\
I am a **Software & Algorithm Engineer** specializing in ML and performance analysis.\
Currently in my MSc in Computer Science at Reichman University, I'm focusing on Reinforcement Learning and NLP.\
I have an interdisciplinary mindset and bring experience and know-how from across the spectrum of applied research - from theory and analysis to full-stack development and SW engineering. I'm able to discuss, theorize, and plan - and then go build it. I enjoy all parts of the process.

Previously, I worked on Autonomous Driving at **General Motors**, developing advanced analytical tools and workflows for evaluating the performance of various components of the AV stack.
